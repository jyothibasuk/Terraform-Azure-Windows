# Terraform-Azure-Windows
Terraform scripts in Azure for Windows

while setup.
1) each version had different/ changes in attributes, should be careful
2) should check on os_profile_windows_config
3) *imp: for calling already assigned value = don't keep inverted commas, newly assaining we need to keep in inverted commas".

while terraform init,
1) need to have version in code & each time version is updated try to run init to load plugins ans supporting file.
2) also remember to keep features {} in provide block to avoid error.

while terraform validate
1) try to keep all ip address as ["10.1.0.0/24"], to avoid error.

while destroying 
1) during destroy network interface is not deleted, as it is associated with a resources. we need to disassociate in order to delete it. i have deleted directly from azure website.
(go to nic and network group, from there we can disassociate resources of nsg)

2) Network Watcher is also not deleting, manually deleted from portal.
